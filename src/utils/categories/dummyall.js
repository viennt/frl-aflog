A historical romance,which was Bankim Chandra's first Bengali novel, was way more interesting than I had expected it to be. \r\n\r\n Set during the Mughal period, in the backdrop of the Mughal-Pathan rivalry in Bengal, Durgeshnandini is a love triangle between Jagat Singh, Tilottama and Aisha. The action is fast paced and the plot quick. Although it follows the time old tropes of romance - lovers meeting, love at first sight, unexpected problems, parting, misunderstandings and finally their reunion, the book kept me interested. There was enough conspiracy and back stories and secrets to keep me reading. The short chapters also helped.\r\n\r\n Also, the gorgeous, beautiful cover!",

This process is very crucial as it protects the skin from the outer environment. \r\n\r\nSecondly, if you forget or ignore to clean those pores, they tend to increase in size. Yes, which means more dirt and oil! \r\n\r\nSo, wouldn't it be easier to ease the process of cleansing those pores? \r\n\r\nWell for that you can use this \" ice cream\" like texture mask. Volcanic masks have a very essential properties to cleanse the deeper layers of our skin. Importantly, this mask will remove the gunk out of your skin as well as maintain the natural oils. \r\n\r\nPS.
